# Conformio - Compliance Management Platform

A modern compliance management platform built with Vite, React, and TypeScript.

This code was generated by [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.com) for this design: [Source Design](https://magicpatterns.com/c/avxtuuftg8orxv8px2t6wb)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables (see Configuration section below)
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Email Configuration (for trial form submissions)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

**Note:** For Gmail, use [App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) instead of your regular password.

### Email Service Setup

The trial form submissions are sent via email to your configured email address.

#### Using Gmail:
1. Enable 2-step verification on your Google account
2. Generate an App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Use the generated 16-character password in `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

#### Using Other SMTP Services:
Edit `src/services/emailService.ts` to configure your SMTP server.

## Architecture

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/submit-trial-form` - Submit trial form data via email (backend-only)
  - Request body: `{ fullName, email, companyName, teamSize, objectives, utmSource? }`
  - Response: `{ success: boolean, message?: string, error?: string }`

### Frontend Structure

- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/api/` - API client functions
- `src/lib/` - Utilities and helpers
- `src/pages/api/` - Backend API endpoints (Vercel serverless functions)
- `src/services/` - Service implementations (email, analytics, etc.)

### Key Features

- **Trial Form**: Collects user information and sends via email
- **Multi-language Support**: French and English
- **Form Validation**: Client-side with Zod, server-side validation
- **Email Notifications**: Sends confirmation to users and admin notifications

## Security

### Email Management

- **Frontend**: Never exposes email credentials
- **Backend**: Credentials stored as environment variables on the hosting platform
- **HTTPS Only**: All communication is encrypted in production

### Form Validation

- **Frontend**: Initial validation using Zod and React Hook Form
- **Backend**: Complete validation before sending emails

## Deployment
